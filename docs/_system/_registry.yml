## Creation Rules

Before creating ANY new documentation file:

1. Check if content can fit in existing canon file
2. Add entry to this registry first (path, purpose, maintainer)
3. Update SYSTEM_MAP.md if structural
4. Post to Control Room Issue (#24) if decision-related
5. Commit with message: "docs: add [filename] - [purpose]"

Exceptions (no registry needed):
- Evidence files (follow naming pattern)
- Temp files (must be in .gitignore)
- Generated files (transcripts, logs)
